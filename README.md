# Checkers
The Checkers Game project is a Python implementation of the classic board game "Checkers" or "Draughts." It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for playing the game against an AI 

Features:

1. GUI Interface: The game features a graphical user interface built using the Pygame library, allowing players to interact with the game through a visual interface.

2. Game Logic: The project implements the rules and logic of the Checkers game, including valid move generation, piece capturing, king promotion, and determining the winner.

3. Player Modes: The game supports single-player, the  player can challenge an AI opponent that utilizes the minimax algorithm for making intelligent moves.

4. Difficulty Levels: The AI opponent offers different difficulty levels, allowing players to choose the level of challenge that suits their skills and experience.

5. Game State Management: The project includes functionality for managing the game state, including tracking the current turn, keeping count of captured pieces, and handling game resets.

6. Sound Effects: The game incorporates sound effects to enhance the gaming experience, such as sound cues for piece movements and game outcomes.

7. Clean Code Structure: The project follows a modular and organized code structure, separating components such as the game board, pieces, AI algorithm, and user interface for better code maintainability and readability.

8. Asset Integration: The project includes a folder for assets, where images and sounds used in the game are stored and loaded during runtime.

This project serves as a showcase of Python programming skills, game development concepts, algorithm implementation, and graphical user interface design using Pygame. It offers an enjoyable gaming experience and can be further expanded with additional features and enhancements.
